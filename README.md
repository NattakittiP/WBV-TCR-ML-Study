# WBV-TCR-ML-Study
Reproducible clinical ML pipeline with nested CV, calibration, SHAP explanations, and ablation experiments for analyzing WBV–TCR relationships under strict leakage control.
# 📌 Description
This repository contains a complete and rigorously designed machine-learning pipeline for evaluating the relationship between whole blood viscosity (WBV) and triglyceride clearance rate (TCR).
The workflow implements strict leakage control, 5×5 nested cross-validation, isotonic probability calibration, permutation-based SHAP explainability, bootstrap AUC confidence intervals, and a structured ablation experiment comparing TG-only models vs. models incorporating WBV/HCT/TP.

The project highlights reproducible and transparent methodology suitable for clinical and biomedical machine-learning research.
